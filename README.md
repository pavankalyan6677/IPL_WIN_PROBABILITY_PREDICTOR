Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using machine learning. By leveraging historical match data, this model employs a logistic regression classifier to forecast the winning team with an accuracy of approximately 80%. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through a simple application, demonstrating end-to-end machine learning workflows.

This repository is designed to be reproducible, with detailed steps and code provided for enthusiasts and developers to replicate or extend the work.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw IPL data into a structured format suitable for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Handling categorical variables using OneHotEncoder to convert non-numerical data into numerical values.
Model: Logistic regression implemented via Scikit-learn with a pipeline for streamlined training and prediction.
Accuracy: Achieved ~80% accuracy on test data.
Deployment: Model saved using Pickle and integrated into a user-friendly application for real-time predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language (v3.8+ recommended).
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model (Logistic Regression) and preprocessing tools (OneHotEncoder, train-test split).
Pickle: Model serialization for deployment.
Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model development.

Copy
git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/IPL-Match-Prediction.git
cd IPL-Match-Prediction
Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Wrap
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add Dataset:
Place your IPL dataset (e.g., ipl_data.csv) in the data/ folder. The dataset should include relevant features like teams, venue, toss winner, etc.
Usage
Training the Model
Open main.py and ensure the dataset path is correctly specified.
Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and save it:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python main.py
The trained model will be saved as ipl_model.pkl in the models/ directory.
Making Predictions
Use the provided application script:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python app/predictor_app.py
Input match details (e.g., teams, venue) to get the predicted winner.
Exploring the Code
Check notebooks/IPL_Prediction.ipynb for a detailed walkthrough of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values using Pandas functions (drop, replace, etc.).
Preprocessing: Converted categorical features (e.g., team names) into numerical values using OneHotEncoder.
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into features (X) and target (y), then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Pipeline: Used Scikit-learn’s Pipeline to combine preprocessing and logistic regression for seamless fitting.
Evaluation: Achieved ~80% accuracy on the test set.
Serialization: Saved the trained model with Pickle for deployment.
Results
Accuracy: ~80% on the test dataset.
Use Case: Predicts the winner of an IPL match based on historical data and match conditions.
Future Improvements
Incorporate advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for potentially higher accuracy.
Add real-time data scraping for up-to-date predictions.
Enhance the application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.
