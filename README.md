Project Overview
This project predicts the outcomes of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using machine learning. It leverages historical match data and a logistic regression classifier to forecast the winning team, achieving an accuracy of approximately 80%. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through a simple application, showcasing an end-to-end machine learning workflow.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw IPL data into a structured format for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Converts categorical variables into numerical values for analysis.
Model: Uses logistic regression for classification, streamlined with a pipeline.
Accuracy: Achieves ~80% accuracy on test data.
Deployment: Saves the model and integrates it into an application for real-time predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language (v3.8+ recommended).
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model and preprocessing tools.
Pickle: Model serialization for deployment.
Jupyter Notebook: Exploratory data analysis and model development.

How to Replicate This Project
Prerequisites
Install Python (version 3.8 or higher).
Have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and Python libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Obtain an IPL dataset (e.g., containing match details like teams, venue, toss winner) from a reliable source.


Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
Download this repository to your local machine using Git or as a ZIP file from GitHub.
Navigate to the project folder.
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Activate it before proceeding.
Install Dependencies:

Use the requirements.txt file to install necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter).
Prepare the Dataset:

Place your IPL dataset (e.g., ipl_data.csv) in the data/ folder.
Ensure it includes relevant features like team names, venue, and match results.
Building the Model
Explore the Data:

Open the Jupyter notebook (notebooks/IPL_Prediction.ipynb) to review the data analysis and preprocessing steps.
Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Preprocess the Data:

Convert categorical columns (e.g., team names) into numerical values using a suitable encoding method.
Split the data into features (input variables) and target (match outcome).
Train the Model:

Use the main.py script to split the data into training and testing sets.
Implement a logistic regression model with a pipeline to streamline preprocessing and training.
Fit the model to the training data.
Evaluate and Save:

Test the model on the testing set to check its accuracy (~80% expected).
Save the trained model to the models/ folder using Pickle.
Running Predictions
Use the Application:

Run the predictor_app.py script in the app/ folder.
Input match details (e.g., teams, venue) to predict the winner based on the saved model.




Results
Accuracy: Approximately 80% on the test dataset.
Use Case: Predicts IPL match winners based on historical data and match conditions.


Future Improvements:
Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Incorporate real-time data for up-to-date predictions.
Develop a graphical interface for the application.
